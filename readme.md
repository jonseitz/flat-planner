##Description
Flat-planner is a web-based app for magazine planning. It allows every staff member at a magazine to view one central flatplan, containing information about the pages in the magazine. 

Every user account includes an organization account of the same name, which can be used for personal projects, test, etc. Separate organizations can be created for different magazines, and then individual flatplans can be created for each issue of the magazine. Pages can be color coded, and marked with slugs for the stories they're set to contain. Users can also add pages and delete pages as the project changes. At the page level, users in the organization can be assigned to work on certain stories, design elements, etc.
